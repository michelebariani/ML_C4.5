# ML_C4.5
Quick and easy build for both C4.5 and C5.0 ML algorithms (by John Ross Quinlan) for a hands-on experience

Building this image downloads and compiles the code from http://www.rulequest.com. A patch is applied to the no more maintained C4.5 code (to make it compile at least).

Please refer to http://www.rulequest.com for use restriction and code licensing applying to C4.5 and C5.0.

My own licensing obviously refers just to my contribution (patch and Dockerfile)
